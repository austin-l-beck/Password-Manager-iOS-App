This is a Password Manager iOS Application build for a coding interview.
This application utilizes DISK and Resolver to store the data into a local repository
I was unable to integrate Firebase as it requires a paid Apple Developer Program membership
You are able to create an account whose information will be stored securely using the build in Keychain API. 
The login password is then encrypted to ensure that it is secured
